# uActor
## Overview
The fastest and most modular actor system that doesn’t force you to pay for what you don’t need

## Examples
Examples can be found [here](src/uactor/examples).

### Features
1. Simplified creation of a tokio actor topic oriented actor
2. Minimum boilerplate code
3. Support different tokio channels including `watch`, `broadcast`, `oneshot`, `mpsc`.
4. Each actor is able to listen up to 30 channels.
5. Added support of actors with single real channel and routing messages to the defined handler  
[Example: Single channel](src/uactor/examples/single_channel_actor.rs)
6. Added tick (actor call each n seconds/millis/etc) support  
[Example: Interval](src%2Fuactor%2Fexamples%2Finterval.rs)
7. Implemented Dependency Injection on pre-start stage to solve cross-references problem ("Actor#1" needs a reference to the "Actor#2", and "Actor#2" needs a reference to "Actor#1")  
[Example: dependency injection](src/uactor/examples/dependency_injection.rs)
8. Integration with tokio/tracing, including tracing of actor lifecycle, messages, and handlers
